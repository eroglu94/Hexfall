# Hexfall Clone Game

Don't judge. This is version v.0.0.0.0.1

I did this game after completing 30/140 lessons for "2D Game Programming with Unity" in Udemy.

In my last lesson, lecturer was teaching how to use .GetComponent<>()

So this assignment became a fast learn experience for me. I can skip most of the lessons now :D

I have done all the instructions for the game
